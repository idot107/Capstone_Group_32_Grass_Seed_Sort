\section{Definitions}
\textbf{Neural network:} The neural network is a matrix that is trained using a deep learning algorithm. \\
\textbf{Test sample:} Our test sample contains 25,000 seeds. \\
\textbf{Target seed:} It is the seed we want from test sample. \\
\textbf{Purity:} The authenticity of the target seed. \\
\textbf{Off-type seed:} The seeds we wish to distinguish from the target seed. \\
\textbf{Webcam:} A plug and play small scale high definition camera that is lightweight portable. \\
\textbf{Raspberry Pi:} A lightweight single board computer. \\
\textbf{Raspbian OS:} A linux based distribution operating system used by default by most Raspberry pi's\\
\textbf{External HDD:} A usb powered hard drive, with extended storage. \\
\textbf{GPU:} Graphics processing unit, optimal for tensor operations. \\
\textbf{Movidius Compute Stick - VPU:} Vision processing unit, used for storing neural networks.\\
\textbf{OpenCV:} Open source computer vision library. \\
\textbf{SQLite:} Database schema. \\
\textbf{Convolution:} Refers to the process of transferring data from one node to another. \\
\textbf{NCSDK:} Neural compute stick software development kit. \\

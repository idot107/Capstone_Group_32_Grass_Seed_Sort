\subsection {Scope}

This document describes the design and creation of the system developed to autom
ate the seperation of pure and off-type seed from samples. 
This document will describe the necessary procedures, technologies and algorithms required to assemple a prototype, 
and how those technologies should be used together.

\subsection {Intended Audience}

This document is intended to be read by individuals interested in the development and design of our seed
seperator prototype. This document will also serve to allow those invested in our progress to understand our design,
and compare it to our progress.

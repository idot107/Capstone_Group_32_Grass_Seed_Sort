        	The primary objective of the project is to automate grass seed sorting. The members of the group will be building software to be able to discriminate between pure grass seeds from all other plant seeds including but not limited to weeds, and crop seeds. The method we will utilize will be a combination of implementing computer vision and deep learning algorithms to accurately identify off type seeds under a high definition camera. This will vastly reduce the stress and workload imposed upon seed analysts, and likely speed up the sorting process. Not only does this project offer a opportunity to improve seed research, but also creates possibilities in other fields where our technology can automate menial and repetitive tasks.

\section{Purpose}
Our project purpose is to reduce the total amount of seed that seed analysts are required to sort by hand by automating a large portion of the process. Our hope is to take large quantities of seeds and sort out between 80-90 \% of the work.

\section{Current Progress}

Currently we have completed documentation of the project requirements and our initial design. As seed proceeds down a conveyer belt, we plan to utilize a camera, and machine learning techniques to identify off-type seeds, and seperate them from the pure seed. With a clear design, and timetable, we have a clear plan for the remainder of the year.

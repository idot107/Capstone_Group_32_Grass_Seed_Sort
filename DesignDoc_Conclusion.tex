\subsection{Rational}

Each subsystem was isolated in the design so as to enable each part to be developed independantly. This will make it easy for us to identify when a task is complete, and makes testing each part of our code easy. 
Knowing that the task is unlikely to be practicle without machine learning, we have essentially built a pipeline that will enable a neural network to process the necessary data. Without this pipeline it would be impracticle to train a neural network to process an entire image.
